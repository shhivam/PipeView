# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Reliable, always-visible network throughput monitoring -- glance at the menu bar for current speeds, open the popover for usage patterns over time
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Core Monitoring Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core Monitoring Engine)
Plan: 0 of 0 in current phase (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 18 requirements; monitoring core first, then menu bar, persistence, popover, and finally historical charts + settings
- [Roadmap]: macOS 14 minimum target for @Observable; sysctl IFMIB_IFDATA as primary network API

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: sysctl IFMIB_IFDATA stability -- Apple could patch the no-batching behavior; implement IFMIB_IFDATA primary with NET_RT_IFLIST2 fallback
- [Research]: App Sandbox + sysctl compatibility unconfirmed for IFMIB_IFDATA; may need notarized direct distribution if sandboxed sysctl is restricted
- [Research]: DST/timezone boundary correctness in data aggregation (Phase 3) needs explicit test cases
